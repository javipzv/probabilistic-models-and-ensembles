# Probabilistic Models and Ensemble Methods on a High-Dimensional Dataset
This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on applying various probabilistic models and ensemble methods to a high-dimensional dataset. The dataset comprises 90 variables without clear semantics. The main goal of this project is to explore and compare different machine learning approaches. A significant part of this project focuses on understanding and managing the bias-variance tradeoff for each method. This tradeoff is crucial in machine learning as it directly impacts the model's performance and generalizability.

## Project Overview
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes 90 variables with no clear semantic meaning. This makes it a challenging test for different machine learning algorithms, allowing us to explore their strengths and weaknesses in detail.

### Methods
The following probabilistic models and ensemble methods were implemented and evaluated:

Probabilistic Models
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Augmented Naive Bayes (ANB)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

Ensemble Methods
- Bagging
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
